                    <p>For two decades, John Adams has helped drive the evolution of Biosphere 2 through positions of progressive responsibility and oversight. Starting in 1995 he lead the terrestrial research initiatives exploring the effect of elevated CO2 on the complex mesocosms of Biosphere 2.</p>
                    <p>Building on his deep knowledge of the facility and its science, Adams became Biosphere 2's Media Coordinator and Public Spokesperson in 1999, fielding inquiries from around the world, building public understanding of the University's groundbreaking earth systems science research and developing its K-12 education programs (Passport to Learning™).</p>
                    <p>Adams' experience and vision filled critical roles throughout that period in several key positions, culminating in his being named Assistant Director of Planning and Facilities, a mantle he held for seven years. In 2014, Adams advanced to his current leadership role of Biosphere 2 Deputy Director. In part, the promotion marked a return to his roots, engaging as a key member of the team that plans and directs all research and related activities inside Biosphere 2 and the surrounding campus.</p>

                    <p>I am a soil scientist with interest in interactions between physical, chemical, and biological processes that take place in the soils. My primary focus is in soil chemistry, including dissolution, precipitation, and sorption reactions in the soils with both basic science applications including critical zone processes, mineral-organic interactions and applied research looking at fate and transport of organic contaminants and nano-particles in soils that is relevant to environmental quality.</p>
                    <p>My research in Biosphere 2 is focused on weathering processes and carbon cycling under influence of abiotic and biological factors. Specifically, we examine inorganic carbon sequestration during dissolution of basalt covering Landscape Evolution Observatory slopes and formation of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on the slopes due to its incongruent weathering. We also study biological weathering, how plants and microorganisms influence rock weathering and soil formation and how products of the weathering are compartmentalized within the ecosystem, as well as effect of climate change on these processes. I lead Biosphere 2 biogeochemistry lab that supports LEO and other Biosphere 2 and University of Arizona projects.</p>

                    <p>My research focuses on what might be called “biogeochemical ecology,” asking questions about how climate interacts with plant physiology, demography, and ecological processes to influence or control biogeochemical cycling from local to global scales.</p>
                    <p>Just one example of the need for more complete understanding in this area is the lack of species interactions in modern global climate models, even though such interactions can be critically important in controlling ecosystem carbon cycling and hence, feedbacks to climate. Progress has been limited by the difficulty of bridging the gap between local-scale ecological interactions and broader biogeochemical processes. I use multidisciplinary approaches that combine classical techniques of field ecology and forestry with advanced technological methods (e.g., the micrometeorological eddy covariance method, isotopic techniques) and modeling to integrate biogeochemical processes to ecosystem scales.</p>

                    <p>Greg is a Biogeographer, which means his science sits at that exciting nexus of understanding how external forces (like environmental and human factors) and internal characteristics (like leaf biochemistry) determine where species can live and thrive.</p>
                    <p>For the last 8 years, the Barron-Gafford research group has been building the field of 'agrivoltaics' -the concept of co-locating agriculture and photovoltaics (renewable energy from solar panels). We began this work in southern Arizona to study the benefits across the food-energy-water nexus, and over the years have developed a national and international program connecting with researchers in Colorado and Oregon (USA), and in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Helping develop science-based solutions to help people adapt to the increasing pressures that come from a changing climate is a personal and professional goal.</p>

                    <p>During the practice of science, we try to better understand how the world around us functions and responds to changes. In the Biosphere 2 rainforest, the research focusses on tropical forest ecosystem and individual plant responses to climate change: increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, increasing temperature, and stronger and more frequent droughts.</p>
                    <p>The research is inherently social in nature, because it is impossible for any human being to fully understand how the world around us functions. For optimal ecosystem research, we also need to understand how we can better communicate and work together.</p>
